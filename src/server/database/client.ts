/**
 * Runs `effect` inside a single postgres.js transaction on one reserved

 * through `currentSql`, so no statement silently uses the pool mid-transaction.
 *
 * Resource guarantees, per reserved connection:
 *
 * - Reservation failure: nothing is held; the attempt fails.
 * - `BEGIN` failure after reservation: the connection is released before
 *   the attempt fails, so a failed BEGIN cannot leak it.
 * - Query failure, typed Effect failure, defect, or interruption: `ROLLBACK`
 *   issues and the connection is released. A failed `ROLLBACK` (for example
 *   a dead connection) can never mask the original failure and the release
 *   is still attempted.
 * - `COMMIT` failure: the connection is still released, and the failure
 *   surfaces as `TransactionFailed`. Commit failures are never retried: the
 *   commit may have succeeded server-side, so retrying could double-apply.
 * - Successful `COMMIT` with a failed release surfaces as
 *   `TransactionFailed` rather than a silent success.
 * - Release runs as an uninterruptible finalizer, so interruption of the
 *   transaction body cannot strand the connection.
 *
 * A serialization conflict or deadlock aborts the whole transaction, so the
 * retry wraps the full acquire/use/release attempt: each attempt reserves a
 * fresh connection and issues a new BEGIN. Attempts are bounded
 * (TRANSACTION_RETRY_ATTEMPTS with exponential backoff); an exhausted conflict
 * propagates as `TransactionConflict`, which maps to 503 like other transient
 * database failures. Only `TransactionConflict` retries — constraint
 * violations, invalid SQL, connection loss, and `TransactionFailed` fail
 * immediately, and interruptions never retry.
