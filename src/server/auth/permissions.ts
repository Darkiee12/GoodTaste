 * Unknown keys are rejected at the role-management boundary, so the client
 * can never invent a permission.
 *
 * Better Auth's admin plugin receives a locked-down configuration built from
 * the same vocabulary (see `pluginAccessControl` / `pluginRoles` below):
 * application authorization is evaluated against the database, never against
 * the plugin's static roles.
